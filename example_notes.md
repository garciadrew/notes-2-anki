# Cell Biology Study Notes

## Cell Structure and Function

### The Cell Theory

The cell theory is one of the fundamental principles of biology. It states three main points:
1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

This theory was developed by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann in 1838-1839, with Rudolf Virchow later adding the third principle in 1855.

### Types of Cells

There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

**Prokaryotic Cells:**
- No membrane-bound nucleus
- DNA is located in the nucleoid region
- No membrane-bound organelles
- Examples: bacteria and archaea
- Typically 1-5 micrometers in size
- Have cell walls made of peptidoglycan (in bacteria)

**Eukaryotic Cells:**
- Have a membrane-bound nucleus
- DNA is organized into chromosomes
- Contains membrane-bound organelles
- Examples: animal cells, plant cells, fungi, protists
- Typically 10-100 micrometers in size
- Plant cells have cell walls made of cellulose

## Cell Organelles

### The Nucleus
The nucleus is the control center of the cell. It contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The nuclear envelope is a double membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Nuclear pores allow molecules to move between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

### Mitochondria
Mitochondria are known as the "powerhouses of the cell". They produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through cellular respiration. The process follows the equation:
C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP

Mitochondria have their own DNA and can reproduce independently. This supports the endosymbiotic theory, which suggests mitochondria were once independent organisms.

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
There are two types of ER:
- **Rough ER**: Studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins
- **Smooth ER**: No ribosomes, synthesizes lipids and detoxifies substances

### Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus modifies, packages, and ships proteins received from the ER. It consists of flattened membrane sacs called cisternae. Proteins enter at the cis face and exit at the trans face.

### Lysosomes
Lysosomes are the cell's recycling centers. They contain digestive enzymes that break down waste materials, cellular debris, and foreign substances. They maintain an acidic pH of about 4.5-5.0.

## Cell Membrane

### Structure
The cell membrane follows the fluid mosaic model:
- Phospholipid bilayer forms the basic structure
- Proteins are embedded throughout (integral proteins) or attached to the surface (peripheral proteins)
- Cholesterol molecules help maintain fluidity
- Carbohydrates attached to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids) for cell recognition

### Transport Across Membranes

**Passive Transport** (no energy required):
- Simple diffusion: Movement of small, nonpolar molecules
- Facilitated diffusion: Movement through protein channels
- Osmosis: Movement of water across a semipermeable membrane

**Active Transport** (requires ATP):
- Primary active transport: Direct use of ATP (e.g., sodium-potassium pump)
- Secondary active transport: Uses concentration gradient created by primary transport
- Bulk transport: Endocytosis (taking in) and exocytosis (releasing out)

## Cell Division

### Mitosis
Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells. The phases are:
1. **Prophase**: Chromosomes condense, nuclear envelope breaks down
2. **Metaphase**: Chromosomes align at the cell equator
3. **Anaphase**: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles
4. **Telophase**: Nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense
5. **Cytokinesis**: Cytoplasm divides, creating two cells

### Meiosis
Meiosis produces four haploid gametes from one diploid cell. It involves two divisions:
- Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes separate (reduction division)
- Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate (similar to mitosis)

Key difference: Meiosis creates genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment.

## Cellular Respiration

### Overview
Cellular respiration converts glucose into ATP through three main stages:

1. **Glycolysis** (in cytoplasm):
   - Glucose → 2 Pyruvate
   - Net gain: 2 ATP, 2 NADH
   - Anaerobic process

2. **Krebs Cycle** (in mitochondrial matrix):
   - Pyruvate → CO₂
   - Produces: 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂

3. **Electron Transport Chain** (inner mitochondrial membrane):
   - NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons
   - Produces: ~32-34 ATP
   - Oxygen is the final electron acceptor

Total ATP yield: approximately 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule

## Photosynthesis

### Light-Dependent Reactions (in thylakoids)
- Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts
- Convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH)
- Water is split (photolysis) releasing oxygen
- Also called the "light reactions"

### Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
- Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts
- Use ATP and NADPH to fix CO₂ into glucose
- Key enzyme: RuBisCO (most abundant protein on Earth)
- Also called "dark reactions" (though they occur during the day)

Overall equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
